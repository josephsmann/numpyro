# Sherpas

- Sherpa (help tourist climb Everest)

- Porter (support Sherpas)

tons of garbage on Everest now.
from 200 climbing expeditions ??

current practice - discard garbage asap. 
retrieve only what is absolutely necessary

15000 trekkers

Waste must be removed by professional climbers

no efforts to remove waste 

6.5 lbs of waster per trekker
(world's highest landfill)

alpine regions have slower decomposition rates

moral infractions: 
    ppl climb over dying climbers

causes of death
    avalanches
    sherpa's die 70% more
    most dangerous time was above 8000 m
    climbers died descending more than sherpa's
    respiratory distress, nausea 
    
    inexperience, and ultra-violet burns in two 
    climbers died 6x sherpas when descending 
    
    Into Thin Air - 8 fellow trekkers passed away.
        confidence of trekkers critical - can affect all
        the kind of person who engages frequently ignores signs of danger.
        one must be driven but also prudent
        
    Change in the proportion of male to female yaks
        over-grazing - reduces fodder grass 
        many yaks are purposefully killed as there is not enough food
        environmental pollution may be affecting water 
        
    Sewage waste from human from the water.
        Water samples
        e-coli bacteria content higher in May than in November due to sunlight
        surface contained more bacteria than ground water
        heavy dependence by local comms no water 
        
    Land and Ecosystem
        most sub - alpine below 4000m are relatively stable
        in contrast above 4000m is heavily disturbed
    Locals use Juniper wood for building
    
    Nepal has unique geophysical features
        lots of natural shit
        tourism can be affected by disasters
    Westernisation of locals
        seasonal unemployment
        dep on imported goods
    During trekking season is critical agri season
        commodisation of crafts for souvenirs
    Clothings styles are changing
        giving up wool clothes for western clothes
    All Sherpa culture has been influenced by Western 
        sherpa resent tourist violation local customs
        also encourage immigration
        tension between those profiting from tourism and those who don't
        
        Sherpa lifestyle is being disturbed by 
        "gradually we are losing are culture and language"
        
        bad because ecosystem and destroying Sherpa culture. high mortality rate that comes along with it.

luxury resorts: why they suck.

from china, india etc now too 

high end hotels - all tha ppl need to do is chill

-
commodification of experience??

land beauty 
quality based on meeting clients needs.

benefits do not reach surrounding community.
locals not consulted 

economic effect fairly limited.

consumer services have become an international product.

Mexico resorts being periphery

move industry away from urban service centres.
Mexico tourism 5% of GDP. 

Env. effects

many built on islands and beaches

new resorts have more construction on their land.

older coral has apparently with older 

-------
social impacts

ability to alienate poorer neighbors (white guilt)

shift in tourist education is nec.
need to dev. relationships and pay equity for the workers

--------
Perceptions

percs. of tourist are often negative 
but we like the money.

the closer to the resort the worse your opinion

in the beginning...
sustainability of tourism requires a relationship
with the community. 
basis of resort ..

land alienation. 
capitalization of authenticity of 
push out local community

a change in tourist education is necessary.

----------
indiginous owend and operated luxury hotel
indiginous casinos - 

compare with mega-events
educate the rich 
expand local economy

if the resorts their would be no money for economy at all.

Wenhai Ecolodge ?

off beaten track
    less economic "leakage" 
        - leakage is tourist money that leaks back to non-local economies

Building tourist thing
Nature Conservancy
    motivation - locals were destroying eco habitat because they neede fuel for homes
    tourism provided economic reason for them to stop.
    
reciprocity, local integration, spontaneous, genuine tourist experience 
super important for creating community engagement and ultimately the
survival of ecolodge.
company "World Nomads" 
Xintuo (pronounced "Shin 2 o") Tour Company

what was missing from initial project was local element
important to have collaboration between communities (otherwise conflict)

- listen to community desires

- important that locals know that its very longterm

- understand the full tourist package

- finding a local champion


- 3733 Community based tourism ?

----------
Partipatory Rural Appraisal video

ask locals for info about 
- natural and physical resources
    - resource map
    (most important tool for a map - insider local's mind)
    - transect
        - line from one end of community to another
        - info goes into chart 
            - eg. soil type, crop, ownership, pests
    - seasonal calendar
        - rain
        - food demands and supplies
        - matrix of plant x health (or anything..)
        
- social and economic factors
    - wealth 
        - family names sorted by wealth
        - how do they know if they are rich
            - appliance, housing, food supply
    - interview how each make a living
    - social
        - where do rich and poor live in village
        - ask women about their roles
- institutions and trends
    - institutions and networks
        - history
        - when were floods, new roads, electricity
    - trend 
        - life getting better or worse
        - how have crops been doin
    - venn diagram
        - centre circle all the villagers
        - sub circles are institutions they come in contact with
        - distance from big circle shows how much influence the institution has on villagers (NOT a quality of a Venn diagram..)

- analyzing and planning
    - villagers get together and record all the info they've collected and correct any errors that may be found. 
    - make chart of areas of concern and associated problems
    - small groups are organized to solve selected problems
    - example problems
        - no drinking water 
        - bad roads
        - no credit 
        - etc.
    - some problems they can fix themselves
    - some problems require outside help and **that costs money!**
        - they can ask gov for help
        - or an NGO
        
Interesting but not tourism...
